## Downsides

This project was built in a short terms, so there are several areas for improvement:
-	Needs More Decomposition: Some components and logic could be further broken down to improve readability and maintainability. Especially `useHistory()`
-   Lack of Redux Persist: Quiz progress and results are not persisted across page reloads or sessions.
-   Issue with framer-motion: There is a known issue with the framer-motion component on the initial quiz request, affecting smooth animations.
-   Mixed Use of Queries and DTOs: Thereâ€™s an inconsistent approach to managing data across different layers, such as the `QuizResultsDTO` and queries.
-   Lack of Tests: Unit and integration tests are missing, which would improve the stability and reliability of the codebase.
